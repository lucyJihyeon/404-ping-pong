Acknowledgment
This project is inspired by the tutorial "Create the Pong Game in JavaScript" by CodeOne. The video provided a solid foundation and understanding of the core concepts required to develop a Pong game using JavaScript. I've adapted and expanded upon these ideas to fit the specific needs and goals of my project. Special thanks to CodeOne for their excellent educational content.
